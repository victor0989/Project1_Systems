Summary: Engine Calibration and Health Monitoring in Pressurized Liquid Propellant Rockets
Example 11â€“2 describes how to convert component test data into nominal engine data for a pressurized liquid rocket engine using 75% ethyl alcohol (fuel) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer). The design aims to achieve 500 lbf of sea-level thrust with a mixture ratio of 1.30. The chamber pressure is nominally 300 psia, with combustion gases having a specific heat ratio (k) of 1.22. Component tests revealed pressure losses in valves, lines, injectors, and cooling jackets.

The following steps are performed:

Correct Test Results:

Thrust chamber data is corrected for deviations in thrust, mixture ratio, and specific impulse.

Specific impulse variation with mixture ratio is negligible due to the close match between actual and desired ratios (1.29 vs. 1.30).

The chamber pressure is corrected to bring thrust down from 541 lbf (test) to 500 lbf (design). Using equations for thrust coefficient (CF), a new pressure of 304 psia is derived.

Flow Rates:

From the specific impulse (223 sec), total propellant mass flow rate is calculated: 2.27 lbm/sec, split into 0.975 lbm/sec fuel and 1.267 lbm/sec oxidizer.

Correct Pressure Drops:

Using a scaling equation that relates pressure drops to flow rate and fluid density, all component losses are recalculated to match design flow conditions.

Example: the fuel injector pressure drop increases to 42.5 psi under actual fuel conditions.

Tank Pressure Calculation:

By summing injector, valve, line losses, chamber pressure, and tank head pressure, required tank pressures are:

Fuel tank: 399.9 psi

Oxidizer tank: 346.6 psi

Pressure Equalization:

To use a single pressure regulator, the system balances pressures by adding a calibrated orifice in the oxidizer line, creating a pressure drop of 52.7 psi.

The required orifice area is computed (assuming a discharge coefficient Cd = 0.60), resulting in an orifice diameter of 0.072 inches.

System Calibration:

These calculations can be programmed into a computer for engine calibration.

Transient performance during engine start can also be accounted for using system dynamic models.

There is a trend toward tighter tolerances in thrust, mixture ratio, and specific impulse, requiring more precise measurement and adjustment than in the past.

Engine Health Monitoring System (HMS)
An HMS is a sophisticated system that monitors rocket engine performance in real-time.

Key parameters such as chamber pressure, pump speed, and turbine gas inlet temperature are tracked.

HMS can support engine calibration by comparing real-time corrected data with ideal engine data, enabling automated or technician-assisted adjustments (e.g., changing orifices or valve timing).

HMS is crucial during development tests for detecting and addressing potential failures before they occur, significantly improving reliability and engine lifespan.
