=================== ADVANCED SPACECRAFT SYSTEM SCRIPT ===================

MISSION PROFILE:
Design a next-generation spacecraft inspired by the SpaceX Falcon 9,
equipped with plasma-based propulsion and alternative fuel systems for
operations in weak atmospheres and high-radiation planetary environments.

VISUAL ENVIRONMENT:
- Background: Low Earth orbit or eroded planetary surface (solar storm damage)
- Plasma Effects: Blue/purple magnetic exhaust jets from VASIMR thrusters
- Materials: High-detail composites with ceramic, titanium alloy, and
  radiation-shield coatings
- Technical Labels: e.g. "RF PPU 48 kW", "ICRH Booster", "Specific Impulse: 5000s"

STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS:
- Composite Fuselage: Advanced radiation/thermal shielding
- Modular Hull Sections: For maintenance under disaster-resilient conditions
- Surface Wear: Simulated micrometeorite abrasion and solar weathering

PROPULSION SYSTEM:
- Main Engine: Merlin-D (chemical ignition)
- Plasma Drive: VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket)
- Cold Gas Thrusters: Formation flying and station-keeping

PROPULSION DETAILS:
- Plasma Source: Ionized helium or argon
- Booster Stage: ICRH (Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating)
- Exhaust Nozzle: Magnetic channeling with visible plasma flux
- Specific Impulse: Up to 5000 seconds in high-power mode

AVIONICS & CONTROL:
- FPGA Platform: Xilinx Vivado with MicroBlaze processors
- Language: VHDL-based dynamic control systems
- Functions: Sensor fusion, attitude control, telemetry routing
- Architecture: Fault-tolerant, reprogrammable for deep-space adaptation

THERMAL SYSTEMS:
- Radiators: Graphene-based heat exchangers
- Cooling Loops: Dual-phase liquid for high-load operations
- Range: -130°C to +190°C

ENGINEERING GOALS:
- Survive long-term cosmic exposure and natural disasters
- Realistic, modular systems for manned or unmanned missions
- Visual realism suitable for documentation, simulation, or cinematic output
