5. Manufacturing Process Summary
Selection and mixing of special alloys.

Continuous casting and melting to form ingots.

Hot rolling for initial forming of basic parts.

Shape rolling for specific shapes (nozzles, rings, supports).

Cold rolling for parts with critical tolerances (shaft, seals).

Heat treatments to optimize strength and ductility.

Assembly with laser welding and dimensional control.

Application of thermal and protective coatings.

Integration of sensors and electronic systems.

Non-destructive testing and final calibration.
