Temperature in Space - Environmental Description

1. Deep Space (Far from Stars and Planets)
------------------------------------------
Temperature: ~2.7 K (-270.45 °C)
Explanation: Cosmic Microwave Background radiation sets this baseline temperature.
Environment: Near absolute zero; negligible particle density.

2. Near a Star (e.g., Sun)
--------------------------
- At Mercury distance (~0.39 AU): Surface temperatures can reach up to 430 °C on sunlit sides.
- At Earth distance (~1 AU): Objects exposed to sunlight can reach ~120 °C; shadowed areas drop to around -100 °C.
- At Jupiter distance (~5.2 AU): Average temperature ~-145 °C due to reduced solar flux.

3. Near Massive Stars (e.g., Blue Giants)
-----------------------------------------
Surface temperatures on exposed objects can exceed 1000 °C due to intense radiation.
Radiation types include UV, X-rays; requires advanced thermal shielding.

4. Near Black Holes
-------------------
- Far from event horizon: temperatures similar to deep space (~2.7 K).
- Near accretion disk: plasma temperatures can reach 10^6 to 10^9 K.
- Extreme X-ray and gamma radiation emitted from infalling matter.

5. Near Jupiter
--------------
- Atmospheric average temperature: ~-145 °C.
- Ionospheres and magnetosphere zones can heat locally due to particle interactions.
- Moons have very cold surfaces (~-180 °C or lower).

Implications for Spacecraft Design:
-----------------------------------
- Use materials with high thermal emissivity and low absorption.
- Prepare for large thermal gradients between sunlit and shadowed areas.
- Implement active thermal controls (heaters, radiators, reflective shields).
- Consider radiation shielding for intense UV, X-ray, and particle fluxes.
