| FIRING PROCEDURE - REDSTONE MISSILE                     |
============================================================
Prelaunch:
- Alcohol/Liquid Oxygen fill via trailers and fueling ladder.
- Water/lithium chloride in cooling jacket (based on temperature).
- Peroxide, alcohol, LOX tank pressurization to 21–31 psi.

Power Transfer:
- Switchover from ground to missile battery power.
- Heater-cooler drop tank released post tie-in.

Final Checks:
- Range computer, cutoff computer, lateral computer, warhead.
- Remote firing box activation.
